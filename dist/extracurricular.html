          <h3><span class="text-secondary">Rock-Climbing</span></h3>
          <p>Let me tell you why I just love rock-climbing! It's all about pushing yourself, physically and mentally. Tackling problems and solving them after trial and error.  It teaches patience, persistence, focus,  discipline and never giving up. As a member of Baboon Outdoors Youth Climbing Team, I have learned the hardwork and dedication that goes into training.  This has led me to compete in USA Climbing Bouldering events around the Southern California area. As a senior member of the team, I have also been selected to take on leadership roles, mentoring younger climbers.

          <h3><span class="text-secondary">Artistic Tendencies</span></h3>
          <p>
           A great stress relief for me is engaging in some type of artistic activity.  I have a diverse interest in creative expression.  I am a self taught crocheter, and have made everything from blankets, to sweaters, a tank top and even swimwear for my mom.  I also like to draw.  My sketches cover several subjects, like landscapes, people, lightsabers and dragons! In middle school, my piece was selected to represent my school at a local art display. Because of the positive feedback I have received from my art,  I joined ASB Ambassadors so I could help make all the banners and posters for the pep rallies and sporting events.  It's a great way to be involved at school and spend time with friends doing something I enjoy.

          <h3><span class="text-secondary">Reading</span></h3>
          <p> Escaping in a good book is one of the most satisfying things in life!  I always look forward to school breaks and summer vacation so I can get lost in some new adventure.  I enjoy a variety of genres, Teen Fantasy, Sci-Fi, and Classics.  I find I also enjoy the  majority of assigned reading from my English classes.
