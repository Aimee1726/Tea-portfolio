          <h3><span class="text-secondary">INTERACT</span></h3>
          <p>
            The INTERACT club is funded by the city’s Rotary Club and can be
            found on many school campuses. Its main goal is to give back to the
            community in meaningful ways and teach its members about the
            importance of community service. The club meets twice a week,
            dedicating one day to a meeting to inform members of upcoming events
            and another day to collecting the school’s recycle. INTERACT works
            with other organizations and companies to hold major events on the
            weekends. Some of my favorite events include decorating floats for
            the Rose Parade, organizing Christmas gifts for foster children and
            working with Payless shoe stores to give shoes to less fortunate
            children. My time in INTERACT as Vice President allowed me to be
            more involved in the planning of these events and helped me feel
            closer to my community.

          <h3><span class="text-secondary">Rock-Climbing</span></h3>
          <p>
            Let me tell you why I just love rock-climbing! It's all about
            pushing yourself, physically and mentally. Tackling problems and
            solving them after trial and error. It teaches patience,
            persistence, focus, discipline and never giving up. As a member of
            Baboon Outdoors Youth Climbing Team, I have learned the hardwork and
            dedication that goes into training. This has led me to compete in
            USA Climbing Bouldering events around the Southern California area.
            As a senior member of the team, I have also been selected to take on
            leadership roles, mentoring younger climbers.

          <h3><span class="text-secondary">Artistic Tendencies</span></h3>
          <p>
            A great stress relief for me is engaging in some type of artistic
            activity. I have a diverse interest in creative expression. I am a
            self taught crocheter, and have made everything from blankets, to
            sweaters, a tank top and even swimwear for my mom. I also like to
            draw. My sketches cover several subjects, like landscapes, people,
            lightsabers and dragons! In middle school, my piece was selected to
            represent my school at a local art display. Because of the positive
            feedback I have received from my art, I joined ASB Ambassadors so I
            could help make all the banners and posters for the pep rallies and
            sporting events. It's a great way to be involved at school and spend
            time with friends doing something I enjoy.

          <h3><span class="text-secondary">Reading</span></h3>
          <p>
            Escaping in a good book is one of the most satisfying things in
            life! I always look forward to school breaks and summer vacation so
            I can get lost in some new adventure. I enjoy a variety of genres,
            Teen Fantasy, Sci-Fi, and Classics. I find I also enjoy the majority
            of assigned reading from my English classes.
