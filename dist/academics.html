          <p>
            I treat my academics like my career,  I have a strong work ethic and like to pay attention to the details. My approach is to always show up and be on time. When I am in the classroom, I am focused and engaged.  Bare minimum is not enough, I like to meet with teachers when they offer extra help and turn in extra-credit assignments. Effort is everything, and my teachers all know that I always put in 100%.

          <p>
            I have maintained a non- weighted GPA of 3.8 (weighted 4.5), throughout my time in high school.  My freshman year I was among  the Top 10  students of my class. I have maintained my position in the top 10% of my class since then.

          <h3><span class="text-secondary">Self Development</span></h3>
          <p>
            Some of the ways I like to stay on top my studies, is by using the tools on Khan Accademy.  I am not afraid to sit down and visit various websites that will help me with understanding any subject matter I am struggling with.  I find the research process helps me get a better grasp on the concepts that may not be so clear to me.  The medical field interests me, and I enjoy watching Instagram Videos and YouTube Videos that explore these topics.

          <h3><span class="text-secondary">Achievements and Goals</span></h3>
          <p>
            I have been on the Principal's Honor Roll every semester.  I have taken and passed 4 AP classes up to this point.  Of these 4 classes, I have passed 3 of the AP exams, my Language Composition with a perfecrt score of 5. My goal is to complete my senior year with straight A's, and be in the top 5% of my class.  After high school, my goal is to find and be accepted to the university that best suites my goals of personal growth and intellectual development, not only for ther sake of a rewarding career, but also to make me a more well rounded individual.
